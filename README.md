## Overview

This project aims to forecast food demand for a given set of outlets or regions by analyzing past sales data and external factors such as seasonality, promotions, and weather conditions. Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste and optimizing supply chains in the food industry.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes:
- **Sales Data**: Historical records of food item sales.
- **External Factors**: Variables such as weather, holidays, and promotions that might affect food demand.
- **Time-Series Information**: Date-related information to identify seasonal patterns and trends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project begins with a thorough exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the data. Key analyses include:
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifying food demand peaks and troughs.
- **Influence of Promotions**: Understanding how promotional events affect demand.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Analyzing demand by region or store location.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models are implemented to forecast future food demand:
1. **Linear Regression**: A baseline model for demand prediction.
2. **Random Forest**: A more advanced model that captures non-linear relationships.
3. **Gradient Boosting**: A powerful ensemble technique for demand forecasting.
4. **Time Series Models (ARIMA)**: Specifically used for capturing temporal patterns in the data.

Each model is evaluated using relevant performance metrics to determine its predictive power.

## Results

The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**

The best-performing model is used to generate forecasts, which are then visualized in Tableau to assist in decision-making.
